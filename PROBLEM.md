# Problem Statement: Make an add to cart app with all React Redux concepts
### 1. Start a new sample app and install react-redux
### 2. Add the following functionality with redux actions -> reducers
 - /home - lists all the product
 - Each product card will have a  price and an 'add to cart' button
 - When add-to-cart is clicked, that product is added to cart

 - /cart - lists all the products
 - Each product in cart can be added/increased in quantity, and hence the total cart value adjusts/reflects to that
 - Each product in cart can be removed, and hence the total cart value adjusts/reflects to that
